    //The main method brings all of the classes together
    //This is where all the prompts and input will be put all togehter to make Battlship
    //TO DO: I still need to implement a way to check the guesses. I think I will do it here.
    //I will do it by checking if game[num][num] equals one, if so then hit and if not then it is not a hit
    //If it is not a hit then change it to be a 2, but if it is then make it another number such as 3. Then I can
    //use these number to then check if the guess has been made and also where the hits are. After there are no more zeros then call a method that ends game
    //Also I need to add the classes and methods from the new classes and methods I made yesterday.

    //TO DO (NOT IN THIS METHOD THOUGH): Create a random placement method that way it can be used for both the user and CPU.
    //Also a way to loop the games to make sure it doesnt end prematurely and also prompt the user if they would like to play again.
    //I think I could do this by a do while loop for the former and a conditional for if they would like to play again.
    //Also need to create a board for guessing, though shouldnt be too hard considering I have already made another method similar to it
